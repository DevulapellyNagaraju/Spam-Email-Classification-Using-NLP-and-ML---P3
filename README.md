### Steps to Clone and Run a Streamlit App from GitHub
1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
     Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - After cloning, navigate to the repository folder:
     ```bash
     cd <repository_folder_name>
     ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **Windows**:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - **macOS/Linux**:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Check if a `requirements.txt` file exists in the repository.
   - If it does, install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Run the Streamlit App**
   - Look for a `.py` file that is the main entry point of the Streamlit app (often named `app.py` or `main.py`).
   - Run the app using Streamlit:
     ```bash
     streamlit run <script_name>.py
     ```
     Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the file.

6. **Access the App**
   - Once the app starts, Streamlit will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) in the terminal.
   - Open this URL in your web browser to access the app.
